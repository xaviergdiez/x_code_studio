Including Design Systems and Code-Based Animations shifts you from a "Utility Player" (who just fixes code) to a "Value Creator" (who defines the product experience).

According to your strategy documents, this is your "Golden Triangle": Animation (GSAP), Data (DCO), and Efficiency (Automation).

Here is how to integrate these two specific high-value skills into your "Terminal/System" aesthetic without breaking the brand.

1. The New Service Modules

You need to create distinct "file names" for these offerings in your service list. They shouldn't be hidden inside PRODUCTION.exe.

For Design Systems: DESIGN_SYS.config

The Concept: You don't just "design screens"; you build the infrastructure for design. This appeals to CTOs (scalability) and Creative Directors (consistency).

The Copy:

04 DESIGN_SYS.config Architecting the Source of Truth. "Bridging Figma and React. I build Living Style Guides and Token Systems that ensure the design intent survives the development process. From atomic components to dark-mode architecture." Keywords: Design Tokens, Figma Variables, Component Libraries, Scalability.

For Code-Based Animation: MOTION_UI.run

The Concept: Position this as "High-Performance Motion." It’s not just about making things move; it’s about 60fps performance, battery efficiency, and "scrollytelling" physics—areas where standard designers fail and standard devs lack taste.


The Copy:

05 MOTION_UI.run 60fps Storytelling. "Standard designers use video; I use code. Leveraging GSAP and WebGL to create physics-based, interaction-driven experiences that load instantly. The fluid feel of a native app, in the browser." Keywords: GSAP, WebGL, Scrollytelling, Micro-interactions, Performance.

2. The "Methodology" Section Update

You currently have error.log and success.ts. You should add a section that explains how you combine these unique skills.

Create a new log entry: BRIDGING.log This section explicitly addresses your dual nature (the "Rare Breed" ).

Plaintext
> BRIDGING.log

[INPUT]:  Pure Design (Figma/Adobe)
[INPUT]:  Pure Engineering (React/Node)
[PROCESS]:
   if (Design == Static) {
      Inject(GSAP_Timeline); // Make it alive
   }
   if (Code == Messy) {
      Apply(Design_System_Tokens); // Make it consistent
   }
[OUTPUT]: A product that feels expensive and works flawlessly.
3. Strategic "Tag" Injection

To make sure you are found for these skills (SEO) and to signal them visually, update your Case Study tags.

For Design Systems Projects:

Instead of just React, use: [Design_Tokens], [Figma_API], [Atomic_Design].

For Animation Projects:

Instead of just GSAP, use: [Interaction_Design], [Scrollytelling], [Micro_Anim].

4. The "About Me" Pivot (Teacher Authority)

Your role at NEOLAND is a massive authority signal for Design Systems. You aren't just a user of them; you teach the theory.


Update the Directory_ or About text:

"As a Product Design Master Course Teacher, I train the next generation of designers to think in systems. I don't just hand off code; I build the tools (plugins, automations) that empower design teams to work 10x faster." 

Why this works

It justifies the price: "Making a banner" is cheap. "Building a Design System" is expensive consultancy.

It leverages your specific "Unicorn" status: Most devs hate CSS/Animation. Most designers can't code. You owning both is the value proposition.

It fits the "Agency of One" model: You provide the strategic oversight of a Director (System) and the execution of a Specialist (Motion).
